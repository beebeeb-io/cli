All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- `bb pull` accepts plaintext file paths (e.g., `bb pull Music/notes.md`) in addition to UUIDs

### Fixed
- `bb sync` now sends `file_id` in upload metadata — filenames are correctly decryptable after sync
- `bb ls` gracefully shows `(encrypted)` for files with undecryptable names instead of crashing
- Share URLs now use `https://app.beebeeb.io` instead of `localhost:5173` (server APP_URL config)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- Interactive share picker for `bb unshare` — arrow keys to select, Enter to confirm
- `bb sync` now does continuous watch after initial sync (merges old `bb watch`)
- `bb sync --daemon` installs a macOS LaunchAgent for auto-start on login
- `bb sync --stop` removes the daemon
- `bb sync --once` for one-shot mode (old default behavior)
- Shared path resolution module — `bb ls Music/` works with plaintext folder names
- Compact WebDAV activity logging (request counter instead of per-request lines, `--verbose` for full log)
- Dashboard UI for sync with box-drawn panel showing status, file count, and speed

### Changed
- `bb status` is now an alias for `bb whoami`
- `bb watch` is now an alias for `bb sync` (with deprecation notice)
- Region display shows user's selected region ("Europe") instead of DC details
- Provider name ("Hetzner") removed from all CLI output
- WebDAV handles URL-encoded paths correctly (no more PROPFIND 404 spam)
- Help screen updated with cleaner layout

### Removed
- `bb rotate` stub (key rotation will be designed separately)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- Homebrew upgrade now restores the bin symlink — `bb --version` correctly shows the new version after `brew upgrade`
- Improved Homebrew install detection for the broken-symlink edge case

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- Custom branded help screen with box-drawn header, colored sections, column alignment
- `bb speedtest` — network latency, upload/download throughput, crypto benchmarks, effective throughput, tiered verdict with practical estimates
- File type icons in `bb ls` (📁 folders, 🖼 images, 📄 docs, 🎬 video, 🎵 audio, 📦 archives)
- Relative timestamps ("2h ago", "yesterday", "3 days ago") in ls and shares
- Summary footers on ls ("5 items · 3.8 MB · e2ee")
- Visual quota bar in whoami and quota (color transitions: green → amber → red)
- Region latency ping in whoami
- Per-file upload progress with speed metrics in push
- Download speed + decrypt timing in pull
- Passphrase entropy display in share
- Status indicators in shares (● active, ○ expired, ✗ revoked)
- Directional arrows in sync (↑ upload, ↓ download, ⚡ conflict)
- Live event log with timestamps in watch
- `--json` flag on all commands (structured JSON output for scripting)
- `--quiet` flag on all commands (minimal output, no progress)
- `--no-color` flag + `NO_COLOR` env var support

### Changed
- All commands use shared `ui` module for consistent colors and formatting
- WebDAV suppresses macOS metadata 404 noise (.DS_Store, ._, Spotlight)
- Cleaner startup banners for webdav and watch

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- `bb repair` command — auto-migrates files encrypted with old binary-UUID key derivation to string-UUID (web-app compatible). Supports `--dry-run`.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- Key derivation now uses string UUID (matches web app) — files uploaded via CLI are decryptable in the web app and vice versa
- All commands (push, sync, watch, webdav, share, mount) use consistent key derivation

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- OTA self-update with colored status message (`Updated bb v0.1.3 → v0.1.4`)
- Homebrew-aware updates (runs `brew upgrade` when installed via Homebrew)
- Shell installer: `curl -fsSL https://get.beebeeb.io | sh`
- `bb shares` now decrypts filenames

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- OTA self-update: checks GitHub releases on startup, auto-downloads and replaces binary
- Comprehensive README with full command reference, sync/watch/WebDAV guides, security model
- CONTRIBUTING.md and CHANGELOG.md

### Fixed
- Filename decryption for web-uploaded files (dual key derivation: binary + string UUID)
- Chunk content decryption for web-uploaded files (raw binary + JSON format support)
- `bb push` now sends client-generated file_id so encryption keys match stored file ID
- `bb shares` decrypts filenames (was showing "unknown" for all entries)
- `bb quota` shows real plan data instead of "unlimited"
- WebDAV filters macOS metadata files (.DS_Store, ._, Spotlight, etc.)
- Push conflict detection works with web-uploaded filenames
- Watch and sync commands handle web-app file format
